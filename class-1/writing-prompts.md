# How GitHub works

## 1. Describe what we mean when we say that GitHub is both Git and Hub.
Git: built on Git, an open source version control system, to take explicit steps to make changes to your document/code and keep an detailed log of the changes along the way. This enables you to return to older versions without destroying the current version, reference a specific set of changes when communicating in a group, and identify when a bug was first introduced.

Hub: All about collaboration and community. Issue tracking, pull requests, website hosting and creating Wikis.


## 2. Why might you want to fork a repository?
By forking, you create an exact copy of a repository in your own account, so that you can experiment new changes, try going on your own direction of a project, or just attempt to make edits on project/code you don't have permission to.
